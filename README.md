GU PROJECT Sem4

Ztyper is a Python-based typing speed game with a sleek interface that's smoother than a cat in a cashmere sweater. It uses tkinter and pygame libraries, along with random and time modules, to create an experience that's more fun than a barrel of monkeys on a trampoline.

At the end of each session, Ztyper will tell you your typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) and give you a pat on the back or a gentle nudge, depending on whether you’re a typing ninja, a speedy snail, or somewhere in between.

Key Features:

WPM Calculation: Your typing speed is calculated in WPM, because who doesn't want to know how fast they can type without breaking the sound barrier?

Performance Evaluation: Ztyper doesn’t just tell you how fast you type, it also lets you know if you're average, below average, or if you're typing so fast you're a legend in your own lunchtime.

Error Feedback: Made a typo? Ztyper will let you know with a sound that’s so fitting, you might think it’s mocking you with a gentle “Oops, you missed!”(Not really)

Retry Option: Feeling like you could do better? Hit retry and show Ztyper who’s boss. It’s like a rematch with a keyboard, and you’re totally going to win this time.

Dashboard: you can manage your account, update user details, see your previous scores

Also you can store your details in Mysql Database
